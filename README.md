# Run Length Compressor Challenge

The code here was for run length compressor challenge. It was written in about 15-20 minutes (including the tests), and can most certainly be improved upon.

The approach I took was to figure out the simplested decompress method that I could, then write the compressor, making sure that it would produce output that the decompressor could handle.

This means that the compressor is limited in its effectiveness, but the two should be able to handle any string containing only printable characters.
